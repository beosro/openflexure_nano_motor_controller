Firmware
=====================
You will need to make sure that the Arduino is running the correct 
firmware "sketch".  Assuming you are familiar with the `Arduino IDE`_
you can download the repository from github_ (either download a Zip 
file or clone the repository) and then look in the arduino_code_ folder
for the sketch:
`arduino_code/openflexure_nano_motor_controller/openflexure_nano_motor_controller.ino`.

More information is available in the README.md_ file in the arduino_code_
folder.

Once you've uploaded that sketch to your Arduino, the firmware should 
be done - you can test it in the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE,
though make sure to set the baud rate to 115200 or it won't work!
