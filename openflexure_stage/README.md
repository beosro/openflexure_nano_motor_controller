# Python Scripts

The Python scripts in this folder provide a convenient way to control the motors - they come from the [openflexure microscope software](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope_software/) repository, and it is possible that I should remove them from here and leave them there.  It is worth checking that repo in case there are more up-to-date versions there.
